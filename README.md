# parallel_Bootstrap
Group Project for ST444 on parallel bootstrapping using Python

## Document Outline
### Parallel computing and Bootstraping
- Talk about parallel computing (Yining said the emphasis was here)
- Talk about Bootstrap (Not too deep)

### Explain the Algorithm
- Explain the non-parallel algorithm
- Explain the parallel algorithm

### Test Algorithm
- Apply multiple tests for each algorithm

### Costs and Benefits
- Measure the costs and benefits of each algorithm.
